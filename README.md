## Features
* change the light color
* change beam width
* change beam intensity (50 - 150 %)
* toggle the backlight (radiance around the circlet)
* disable the light when the bearer is in bed
* upgrade circlet to get new features (putting on top of the helmet, overload button, and demister)
* or disable the upgrade system to have all the features from the start
* toggle if the circlet should emit shadows

* To get a possibility to equip circlet while equipping a helmet you should discover iron and spend a valuable chain to get an upgrade.
* To get the overload ability which will be extra handy at the plains you should spend some money, discover silver and clear a couple of caves.
* To get an ability to spawn wisplight without need of equipping wisplight in utility slot and much more valuable ability to despawn wisplight when you are not in need you should craft a wisplight, clear some mines and spend valuable resource - black core.

### Put circlet on top

You can equip circlet without it taking an equipment helmet slot. It works with EAQS. The original helmet will not be shown but will provide armor and stats. Circlet will be shown but don't get you extra armor.

### Overload
Blind your opponents with a bright flash at the cost of some circlet durability. 

The flash only affects enemies if their head is in the light cone. Also all the enemies next to you will be affected.

Blinded enemy will be staggered so you will have a chance to get a critical blow.

After each overload the circlet durability will be damaged a little. Overloaded circlet will take some time to restore its power.

Overload pushes away the Mistlands mists gradually decreasing for set amount of time.

### Demister

Spawn/despawn the wisplight at will. It's basically controllable wisplight with the utility slot freed for megingjord.

## Compatibility
The mod most likely will not work with others circlet altering mods
* The mod is incompatible with [ImprovedDvergerCirclet](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/ImprovedDvergerCirclet/) due to the same nature of the light controller
* The mod is incompatible with [Circlet Demister](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Circlet_Demister/) due to demister cross functioning
* The circlets from [CustomDverger](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/CustomDverger/) will not be controlled
* The light from [HeadLamp](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Alpus/HeadLamp/) will not be controlled
* The compatibility with [CosmeticSlots](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Frogger/CosmeticSlots/) needs further testing but it may work
* To provide compatibility with [Jewelcrafting](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/Smoothbrain/Jewelcrafting/) disable armor stand visual state
